        <h2>What is Genshin Impact?</h2>
        <p>Genshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released in September 2020 for various platforms, including PC, PlayStation, iOS, and Android. The game is set in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is divided into seven distinct nations, each with its own culture, architecture, and elemental affinity.</p>
        <p>In Genshin Impact, players take on the role of the Traveler, a mysterious individual who has traveled to Teyvat in search of their lost sibling. Along the way, they encounter a diverse cast of characters, each with their own stories, personalities, and combat abilities. The game's story unfolds through quests, cutscenes, and interactions with NPCs, revealing the mysteries of Teyvat and the secrets of the Traveler's past.</p>
        <p>One of the defining features of Genshin Impact is its real-time combat system, which allows players to switch between characters on the fly and utilize their elemental powers to chain together powerful combos. Each character in the game is associated with one of seven elements: Anemo (wind), Geo (earth), Electro (electricity), Dendro (nature), Pyro (fire), Hydro (water), and Cryo (ice). By strategically combining different elemental abilities, players can create elemental reactions that deal additional damage to enemies or provide various buffs and effects.</p>
